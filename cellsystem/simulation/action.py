        Params:
        
            action (function): The procedure to be executed.
            
            probability (optional numeric or function):
                    The numeric probability or probability function.
                    Default is 1 (do always).
                    
        A complex action (with several arguments) can be executed
        by passing the arguments to the ``try_action`` method::
            
            >>> def complex_fn(a,b,c,d): return a,b,c,d
            

            >>> action = Action(a_func, probability=1)

            # Arguments are passed to `complex_fn`
            >>> action.try_action(1,2,3,4)
            (1,2,3,4)
                    
        The probability can be specified in several ways. 
        One of them is by giving a numeric value::
        
            # The procedure
            >>> def a_func(): pass
            
            >>> action = Action(a_func, probability=0.5)
            
            # The procedure will be executed ~50% of the times
            >>> action.try_action()
            
        Also, a function with no parameters will do the job::
        
            >>> action = Action(a_func, 
            ...                 probability=lambda : 0.5)
            
            # The procedure will be executed ~50% of the times
            >>> action.try_action()
            
        For more complex probabilities, one must specify the 
        desired probability to ``try_action``::
        
            >>> def complex_prob(a,b,c,d): return 0.5
            

            >>> action = Action(a_func, complex_prob)

            # Calculate the probability
            >>> p = action.probability(1,2,3,4)
            
            >>> action.try_action(probability=p)
