"""
Module implementing the Cavender-Farris-Neymann stochastic tree model.

The model is based on the description by the book:
    
    Computational Phylogenetics.
      An introduction to designing methods for phylogeny estimation.
      -- by Tandy Warnow
      
Usage:

```python
# Create a new empty tree.
cfn = CFN_Tree()

# Branch randomly until you have 5 leaves.
cfn.populate(5)

    # Node: 0, node probability: 0
    # Node: 1, node probability: 0.45158852704268865
    # Node: 2, node probability: 0.11424818655999902
    # Node: 3, node probability: 0.4264051970154286
    # Node: 4, node probability: 0.459742963797842
    # Node: 5, node probability: 0.3654757150714647
    # Node: 6, node probability: 0.4320439824130711
    # Node: 7, node probability: 0.4988182678649847

The CFN model in words from the book:

"The Cavender-Farris-Neyman (CFN) model describes how a trait (which 
 can either be present or absent) evolves down a tree (Cavender, 
 1978; Farris, 1973; Neyman, 1971).

 ...a CFN model has a rooted binary tree T (i.e., a tree in which 
 every node is either a leaf or has two children) with numerical 
 parameters that describe the evolutionary process of a trait. Under 
 the CFN model, the probability of absence (0) or presence (1) is the 
 same at the root, but the state can change on the edges (also called 
 branches) of the tree. Thus, we associate a parameter p(e) to every 
 edge e in the tree, where p(e) denotes the probability that the 
 endpoints of the edge e have different states. In other words, p(e)
 is the probability of changing state (from 1 to 0, or vice-versa)
 ... we require 0 < p(e) < 0.5.

 Under  the  CFN  model,  a  trait  (which  is  also  called  a  
 “character”)  evolves  down  the tree under this random process, and 
 hence attains a state at every node in the tree, and in particular 
 at the leaves of the tree. You could write a computer program for a 
 CFN model tree that would generate 0s and 1s at the leaves of the 
 tree; thus, CFN is a generative model.
 
 Each time you ran the program you would get another pattern of 0s and 
 1s at the leaves of the tree. Thus, if you repeated the process 10 
 times, each time independently generating a new trait down the tree, 
 you would produce sequences of length 10 at the leaves of the tree."
