# CellSystem

An agent-based framework for the simulation of biological cell systems (although it could conceivably do more).

This was created to simulate cancer growth, taking into account nutrients and cell migration while allowing to couple mutations and ancestry logging to study tumour phylogeny reconstruction algorithms.

## Example

A use case integrated in the repository:


```python
from cellsystem import *

# The cell system will simulate cell growth
# while tracking the steps in that process.
system = CellSystem(grid_dimensions=(10, 10))

# Initialize the first cell
# in the middle of the grid
system.seed()


   # New cell 0 added @ (5, 5)


# Take 35 steps forward in time
system.run(steps=30)


    # Cell no. 0 dividing @ (5, 5)
    # 	New cells: 2 @ (4, 5) and 1 @ (6, 6)
    # Cell no. 2 mutating @ site (4, 5) (father 0)
    # 		 Initial mutations: []
    #                 	 Initial genome: AAAAAAAAAA
    # 		 Final mutations: [(3, 'C')]
    #                 	 Final genome: AAACAAAAAA
    # Cell no. 1 dividing @ (6, 6)
    # 	New cells: 4 @ (6, 6) and 3 @ (5, 6)
    # Cell no. 2 death @ site (4, 5) (father 0)
    # Cell no. 3 migrating from site (5, 6) (father 1)
    # 	 New site: (4, 5)
    # Cell no. 4 death @ site (6, 6) (father 1)
    # Cell no. 3 dividing @ (4, 5)
    # 	New cells: 6 @ (3, 6) and 5 @ (3, 5)
    # ...
    # ...
    # ...


# Prepare to explore the simulation logs
history = system['log']

tree_style = {'show_leaf_name' : True,
              'mode' : 'c',        # Circular tree
              'arc_start' : -135,  # Degrees
              'arc_span' : 270 }   # Degrees also


# Lookup the tree formed by cellular division
history.ancestry().show(styling=tree_style)
```

![png](assets/output_6_0.png)

```python
# Now, remove cells that are no longer alive
history.ancestry(prune_death=True).show(styling=tree_style)
```

![png](assets/output_7_0.png)

```python
# Now, check out the tree formed by the mutations 
history.mutations().show(styling=tree_style)
```

![png](assets/output_8_0.png)

```python
# Remove genomes with no living representatives.
history.mutations(prune_death=True).show(styling=tree_style)
```
