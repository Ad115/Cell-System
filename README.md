# CellSystem

> Let cells do their own thing while you silently observe them.

A simple framework that allows (or will allow) you to couple seamlessly a custom observer (logger) to your simulations.

This was created to simulate cancer growth, while allowing to couple mutations and ancestry logging to study tumour philogeny reconstruction algorithms.

## Example

A use case integrated in the repository:


```python
from cellsystem import *

# The cell system will simulate cell growth
# while the log tracks the steps in that process.
sys = CellSystem()
log = FullLog()

# Initialize the first cell
sys.seed(log=log)


   # New cell 0 added @ (5, 5)


# Take 35 steps forward in time
sys.step(30, log=log)


    # Cell no. 0 dividing @ (5, 5)
    # 	New cells: 2 @ (4, 5) and 1 @ (6, 6)
    # Cell no. 2 mutating @ site (4, 5) (father 0)
    # 		 Initial mutations: []
    #                 	 Initial genome: AAAAAAAAAA
    # 		 Final mutations: [(3, 'C')]
    #                 	 Final genome: AAACAAAAAA
    # Cell no. 1 dividing @ (6, 6)
    # 	New cells: 4 @ (6, 6) and 3 @ (5, 6)
    # Cell no. 2 death @ site (4, 5) (father 0)
    # Cell no. 3 migrating from site (5, 6) (father 1)
    # 	 New site: (4, 5)
    # Cell no. 4 death @ site (6, 6) (father 1)
    # Cell no. 3 dividing @ (4, 5)
    # 	New cells: 6 @ (3, 6) and 5 @ (3, 5)
    # ...
    # ...
    # ...


# Tree styling
ts = TreeStyle()
ts.show_leaf_name = True
ts.mode = "c"
ts.arc_start = -135 # 0 degrees = 3 o'clock
ts.arc_span = 270

# Lookup the tree formed by cellular division
log.ancestry().show(tree_style=ts)
```

```python
# Now, remove cells that are no longer alive
log.ancestry(prune_death=True).show(tree_style=ts)
```

![png](assets/output_7_0.png)

```python
# Now, check out the tree formed by the mutations 
log.mutations().show(tree_style=ts)
```

![png](assets/output_8_0.png)

```python
# Remove genomes whose representatives are no longer alive
log.mutations(prune_death=True).show(tree_style=ts)
```
