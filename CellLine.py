    A cell lineage is a group of cells that have a common ancestor, we represent the common \
    ancestor by it's genome, so, in this setting, the cells in a cell line share a common \
    ancestral genome.
    This structure is in charge of holding this ancestral code and managing the cells \
    creating new cells when needed and cleaning up the dead ones.
