# C translation attempts

An attempt to translate to C code the code in the `simplecells.py` code (in Python).

The `simplecells.py` script is a simplified version of the whole simulation. It serves as a proof of concept. 

The `src/main.c` file is the entry point, equivalent to the main routine of the Python code.

## How to run it

 1. Download the code. 
 2. Go to this folder (called `c`). 
 3. Type in a terminal: `make` to compile the code.
 4. Excecute the `main` binary that was created.
